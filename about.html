        About Me
      </h3>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Founder: Chinmay Kulkarni: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinmaykulkarni9/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
      <p>
      Chinmay Kulkarni, current fulltime MBA student at Emory University - Goizueta Business School, has nearly 4 years of industry experience as a hardware engineer, working for a startup innovating on indoor location tracking technology, and at Qualcomm in Silicon Valley, working on integrating key electronic components for the iPhone15.<br><br>

      Before starting full time employment, Chinmay received his education in electrical engineering from Georgia Tech in Atlanta. During his time there, he noticed that several of his fellow engineering classmates had issues with technical engineering interviews, with difficult questions requiring a greater amount of subject matter knowledge that often may not be covered in class or would be forgotten as a result of the rigor of classwork. Yet, this challenge was greatly reduced for fellow computer science students, who had access to greater resources to test and hone their coding interview skills. Therefore, the idea for InterviewAware was born â€“ to bring a similar service to engineering classmates.<br><br>

      While the MBA program is a time-consuming challenge, Chinmay plans to fully build out this MVP product that will have mass appeal to engineering job seekers. With the vision of partnering with engineering experts working at some of the most coveted firms, content will be created and shared to create highly reputable sources of engineering interview preparation.

      <h3>
        About InterviewAware
      </h3>
      <p>Welcome to InterviewAware! The world's first engineering interview prep service. We understand that interviewing is a difficult and messy ordeal, going from source to source, looking up endless online videos and message boards with suspect interview insights. Our focus is to bring a high level of transparency to the engineering interview process, by practicing technical engineering skills, testing design fundamentals, and refreshing even the brightest of engineers on obscure topics that were not covered since college.<br><br>
      
      We know that the cool thing to study is coding, and likewise, there are several excellent resources out there for studying and brushing up on computer science fundamentals... why can't engineering disciplines have the same resources? We believe to land a dream job, in Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, or other engineering disciplines, that we can take the anxiety out of interview preparation to make everyone place their best foot forward.<br><br>

      There are numerous issues with the scattered sources that engineers use for interview preparation. YouTube, often has videos that are far too long, or often even in a different language. Wikipedia likes to display educational material in a confusing maze of hyperlinks and texts. Finally, sources like Reddit and Glassdoor use a crowdsourcing strategy that often leads to incomplete or incorrect interview questions and related materials. <br><br>

      It's a shame that engineering interview prep is highly convoluted and disaggregated. This is the vision and the issues that InterviewAware wishes to solve.
